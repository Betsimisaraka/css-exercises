1- Describe in your own words what BFC is all about.
When you set a border around everything which you do and everything are included inside of that box.

2- We can 'clear' a float by creating a block formatting context on the parent, this is achieved by putting a certain set of properties on the container. What are those properties?
padding, border, margin, width and height.

Maybe, but I don't know.
