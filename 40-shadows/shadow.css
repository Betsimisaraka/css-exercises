1- `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` have very similar value syntax.

  We can't use thickness value and a inset in the text-shadow.
  But we can use all of the value on box-shadow.

3- If I wanted to create a hard-edge shadow, one that looks like a solid border, combination of values would I need to use:
You have to use x, y, blur, thickness, and color.

3- Is it possible to create a shadow on a circular element?
 Yes, it is, make a border-radus

Yes, it is but you have to separate them with a comma.
