  Questions
  =======================

  - What is the difference between `opacity` and a `background-color` that is semi-transparent?
  - What is the difference between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;`?
  - Why would we use `visibility: visible;`?

*/
/*  Opacity
    Opacity property sets the quality of non transparency, and the degree to which content behind an element is hidden.
*/
opacity {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* Display 
   Display property specifies whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.
*/

display {
  display: block;
}

/*Visibility
  Visibility property specifies the showing or hiding  an element without changing the layout of a document.
*/

visibility {
  visibility: hidden;
}

/* Opacity can affect with the element child. But for the background color is just affect the spacific element.

'Display: none'; means that the tag or the lement will not appear on the page at all. visibility: hidden; will hide the element, but the element will still take up the space it would if it was fully visible.

We use 'visibility: visible' because we want the thing which we hidden before to be seen again.
