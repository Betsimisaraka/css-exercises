/* Inheritance 
We mean by inheritance is like when we don't put the specific value for a property on an element. It can affect in all the element children from their parent.

The properties that have value that are inherited by default are: font-family, font-weigth, font-size, font-style and color.

For the currentColor keyword is we just want the color value to work with the spacific element of an element. 
But with the inherit keyword it will apply with all the children of an element and in that case the currentColor will not be seen.

 Initial is to tell the browser to set the default value of the property which we use.
 Unset we can still put some styles with unset value.
